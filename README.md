# Split Federated Learning and Federated Learning

This is partly the reproduction of the paper of [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629)   
Only experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 (both IID and non-IID) is produced by far.

Note: The scripts will be slow since it is a simulation and without the real implementation of parallel computing of different clients. 

## Requirements
python>=3.6  
pytorch>=0.4

## Run

> bash run_fed.sh

> bash run_sfl.sh



## Ackonwledgements
